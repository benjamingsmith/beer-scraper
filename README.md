## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **Axios** - HTTP client for web requests
- **Cheerio** - Server-side jQuery implementation for HTML parsing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This scraper depends on the current HTML structure of the target websites
- Scrapers may break if the websites update their layout
- Be respectful of the websites' servers - avoid excessive requests
- Consider implementing caching to reduce load on target servers

## üîß Development

To modify or add new brewery scrapers:

1. Create a new file in the `locations/` directory and include the import/export in `/locations/index.js`
2. Implement the scraping logic using Axios and Cheerio
3. Add the new route to `index.js`
4. Export your scraper function for use in the main application
